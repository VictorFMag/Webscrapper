# Webscrapper
A simple code that reads the HTML of an URL and writes in an external file all the filtered tags.

# How to use it?
Open the code in your code editor, open the integrated terminal and type 'npm install'. This will install all the dependencies of the code, that are basically Axios and Cheerio. You can also choose to type 'npm install axios' and 'npm install cheerio' instead of 'npm install'.
After that, type 'node index.js' to run the code.
